<h2>Barcelona 0-0 Rayo Vallecano - Match Review</h2>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185511145-a0c07b22-bf52-4336-a402-f42b67058f9a.png" width="600" height=auto>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>So, first match of the season against an opponent that had beaten us twice last season, we again failed to break through the stubborn defense of Rayo Vallecano. It was a frustrating match to watch, nearly 70% possession more than 20 shots yet that opening goal never came. The low block of Rayo again was an obstacle too big for us to overcome, many of our shots came from long distance or tight angles which can be somewhat reflected in the statline (with only 6 shots on target). That wasn’t to say that we didn’t create any goal scoring opportunities however, Lewandowski, Fati, Aubameyang, Kessie, Raphinha and Dembele all had clear cut chances but failed to convert. Not to mention the sensational performance from Dimitrievski, the Rayo keeper who made a series of great saves to secure Rayo’s deadlock. The ending of the match was an absolute rollercoaster that saw both teams putting the ball in the net but both disallowed, with a red card for Busquets right before Rayo thought they scored the winner in injury time. In the end while it is a gutted draw Barca have to be glad that they can take away one point in the La Liga opener.
    </p>
<p>The atmosphere in Camp Nou yesterday was brilliant, the attendance and fan reactions were to a degree that we haven’t seen for quite a while. The enthusiasm from fans from a summer of big signings is expected, and with hype comes what we didn’t have in the last few seasons - an expectation to succeed. To any casual fans or fans or other clubs, a blank against Vallecano will seem like a huge underperformance or even a sign of misfit. Yet we must remember that our new signings have only joined the team for a few weeks, and it is unrealistic to expect them to blend in smoothly despite what the preseason games might suggest. It is clear from watching the match that this team is not performing anywhere close to its potential yet, and only time can tell how good they can be. For any fans who may feel shocked or disappointed by the result, I must insist that it is much more important to focus in detail to see what we have been doing wrong and improve it match by match instead of setting an unrealistic expectation for the team. Please stay tuned for the analysis below.
    </p>
<h3>Main talking points</h3>
<h4>1. Penalties that should have been</h4>
<p>To start my analysis with the refereeing might have sounded a bit petty, but it is probably not a stretch to say that the refereeing of this match left much to be desired, especially for a home game. Early on in the game Raphinha got past his man on the right wing and went down near the baseline being clipped on the heel by his defender. I rewatched the clip several times and it seems clear to me that there was contact on his heel, and there is little reason for Raphinha to flop when he has already got past his man in the box anyways. Later in the game Lewandowski was wrestled to the ground by his marker during a Barca corner, but yet again the refs swallowed their whistle. Honestly, that is what we come to expect from La Liga but it is frustrating to witness no less. I would like to mention the Busquets yellow card that got him sent off - Look I can’t really disagree with the yellow card given that he did elbow Falcao in his face, but it also seem to me that it might be a natural position for his hand to be when he is trying to shield the ball. While no doubt a foul I’d say there’s a 7-3 odd of it being a yellow. And after seeing an entire game of rough tackles from Vallecano in our home ground, the second yellow just seemed a little bit too harsh and very hard to swallow.</p>
<p>That said, by no means can we blame the officiating for blowing this match. Bad refereeing and a physical style of play is what we have to contend with if we ever want to achieve success with this team. Focus on putting away chances and limiting defensive error and we should be able to take those two factors out of the equation entirely. </p>
<h4>2. Frenkie De Jong proves his worth</h4>
<p>Xavi opted for Gavi starting in the right center mid over De Jong this game, but it did not stop Frenkie from having a great performance. Entering the game in the second half, he provided the spark that the team desperately lacked. From making runs in the half spaces between the center backs, to dropping deep to receive and progress the ball, and even slotting down into center back position after Busquets getting the marching orders in the nervy ending of the match. An apparently angered and determined Frenkie showed us what we all knew was capable of, and that he was the exact kind of player we needed in our midfield. It was probably his way of showing the world the disgusting gestures of the Barca board. Unfortunately before the transfer window ends we will probably have to continue to cope with the ongoing rumors of him linking to certain premier league teams. Let’s just have our fingers crossed, for the sake of Frenkie and this team, that he will still be with us once this saga is well and truly over.</p>
<h4>3. Wasteful but encourging debut for Lewandowski and Raphinha</h4>
<p>Of course I will have to mention the elephant in the room - the debut of our big signings in this game. Lewandowski was closely marked throughout the game, and it is clear that Rayo wanted to suffocate the box to cut him off from his teammates. But even so we can see him making intelligent runs to set himself free from his marker to receive crosses, and he still managed to make quite a few touches in the box. Indeed there were also quite a few chances that he should have put in the net, but with a quality striker like him we should expect these chances to go in in future games. Raphinha also had quite a few good chances that he failed to convert. He looks a bit indecisive at times and may tend to overdribble. I believe that this is a problem of lacking in chemistry with his teammate, and we should expect it to improve with time. He did demonstrate his ability to find open space and be in goal scoring positions and that is something to look to in future games. </p>
<p>Among the newcomers Chistensen had the most solid game. He was confident in possession and had good defensive positioning throughout the game. Although his starting spot might be taken by Koude once Barca register him. Kessie came in as a substitute late game, and managed to put the ball in the net before being called for offside during the buildup. He demonstrated his high workrate across the pitch during his limited minutes. Though it was surprising for Xavi to play him as a central midfielder in Pedri’s place instead of the holding midfielder role. It will be interesting to see how he will be deployed in the coming games. 
</p>
<h4>4. Araujo in for RB, Dest out of squad</h4>
<p>The most surprising lineup selection that Xavi made was excluding Dest from the squad completely and starting Araujo at rb. There were already signs that Xavi didn't count on Dest last season, when Davi Alves was the first choice right back. Nevertheless it was still shocking that Dest did not even make the bench in this game. The experiment with Araujo at rb is, frankly, a poor one. He was mostly reluctant to push too far forward, and rightfully so, because his skill set does not match one of an attacking fullback. He was caught out of position a few times as well, with one of the biggest chances of the game resulting from him losing his man and allowing him to make a run behind him. More importantly than that, however, is that we are sacrificing one of our best (if not the best) center backs and compromising his abilities by playing him as a fullback. If Xavi rather not play Dest then it will be crucial for us to find a new right back. Apart from him the only rb we have left is Roberto, and it will not be ideal if he has to play him as a consistent starter. </p>
<p>Speaking of defense, our performance on that end was not a convincing one. Arguably the game’s biggest chance fell to our opponent, and it was thanks to some great goalkeeping for Ter stegen and an offside from Rayo to not lose in our home ground. Our recurring problem of conceding on opponent’s counters is still not solved yet, and it will be a problem that needs to be taken care of if we truly want to compete against other La Liga teams. </p>
<h4>5. A match to forget for Busquets</h4>
<p>Here it is, a second yellow for Busquets in stoppage time and he is gone. While the call was slightly problematic, it doesn’t change the fact that it wasn’t the best outing for the Barca captain. He couldn’t dictate the pace of the game as he is used to and that contributed to Barca’s inability to create chances.</p>
<p>He will be serving his ban next game which means he will have to be replaced on the starting lineup next game. With Nico on loan to Valencia, there are no natural replacements for the dmf positions in the team. The apparent solution will be to put De Jong or Kessie in that position. However the former will probably limit Frenkie’s attacking chances and the latter may disrupt the flow of the offense given that Kessie is not quite the passer that Busquets is. An interesting option will be to play Eric Garcia in that position so De Jong can start in midfield. It was rumored last season that Xavi considered the possibility of playing Garcia as a dmf, and this move actually makes sense. Garcia is not the best defender but is excellent in keeping possession and progressive passing. With Koude hopefully joining the squad and Araujo not starting at rb, we will have a choice of three center backs even without Garcia. Although it is probably not likely to happen it is certainly an option that is worth a consideration.</p>
<h3>Tactical Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Barca in possession and how Rayo defended</h4>
<p>Starting lineup for Barca:</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185515955-67c5a353-29d1-4779-80f4-6f73cdb71c12.png" width="350" height=auto>
<p>Xavi used the 433 that worked well from last season to start the match. Dembele and Raphinha started on the wing, and exchanged positions in the match perhaps to give the opponent a different look from time to time. As mentioned above, the most notable pick was using Araujo as a right back, while starting newcomer Christensen at his normal position. Vallecano lined up with a 4231 as shown above, but as you will see they mainly played in a defensive 442 throughout the game as Barca dominated possession.</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185512287-09103383-b35c-4b6a-9c14-b0f78770a4a7.png" width="350" height=auto>
<p>In this game Barca had 68% possession. Rayo was generally disinterested in holding the ball and opted to attack quickly whenever they gained possession. Therefore most Barca possessions started with a buildup from the back. As shown in the figure above, Busquets dropped deep to provide an initial passing option while the full backs went higher up the field. Alba is usually positioned higher than Araujo*. Usually what we will see is one of Gavi or Pedri dropping down to facilitate the buildup, either through providing a passing option or progressing with the ball. On the other hand, Rayo defended with a 442 with only 2 to 3 players covering the front half. They seldom commit a lot of players upfield, leaving Barca with a distinct numerical superiority in their own half. For that reason we didn’t have a lot of trouble progressing the ball from our own box this game.</p>
<div class="box">
    <p class="bold">*fan insights</p>
    <p>This is because Alba was an attacking minded full back that usually plays the whole left flank while Araujo is a center back that is more defensive minded and less pacy.</p>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185515961-a001f437-749b-443d-bdb8-8701a3678e78.png" width="350" height=auto>
<p>Once the ball is in the opponent's half, we transition into a roughly 235 formation to attack. Dembele and Raphinha providing the width while Alba and Araujo tuck in as inverted fullbacks*. A common form of attack is for either of the Barca wings to receive the ball out wide and crossing to the middle to create chances. Pedri and Gavi made runs into the box between the Rayo backline to stretch the defense or to receive passes from either wing. Lewandowksi mostly played inside the box, being the main target man. He can also use his gravity to make runs to pull away the center backs to create space for his teammates. Occasionally Alba will make runs to the baseline to put in crosses and stretch the defense. To counter Barca’s attack, Rayo used a zoned defense that is very compact in the middle. As soon as Barca advances the ball into the Rayo half their 4 men defensive line falls back to crowd the box. The fullbacks play really narrow, closely packed to not allow any significant spaces in between them, as seen in the figure. The midfield line also drops deep in order to close down any spaces between the midfield and defense line. The positioning is more fluid than the defensive line, depending on where the ball was. The left and right midfielder can often be seen marking the Barca wingers in possession in order to allow the fullbacks to stay compact and narrow. The 2 center mids often drop back into the box to deter any passes inside. It was not uncommon to see 6 or more Rayo players inside their own box during a Barca attack.</p>
<div class="box">
    <p class="bold">*Beginner tips</p>
    <p>Inverted Fullbacks are fullbacks that move into the central midfield position during attacks instead of hugging the touchline and roaming the flank like traditional fullbacks. From the example above, Alba and Araujo are playing either side of the 3 in the 235 with Busquets in the middle. They can provide cover for the 5 players who are attacking high up the pitch, being in a prime position to overload the center part of the pitch to win the ball back if the team loses possession. They can also handle the ball if the offense needs to pass back to reset the play or change sides. Note that neither Alba nor Araujo are pure inverted fullbacks - Alba has the tendency to press higher up the field to make overlapping or underlapping runs while Araujo will sometimes drop deeper into our own half to secure the defensive line.
        </p>
    <p>The invention of inverted fullback is generally credited to Pep Guardiola, who transformed Philipp Lahm and David Alaba as inverted fullbacks during his time at Bayern. Modern day examples of inverted fullbacks are unsurprisingly Man City players e.g. Zinchenko and Cancelo. This style of play is usually seen in teams that dominate possession and press high up the field. The inverted fullbacks are an important addition that allowed these teams to apply extreme pressure to the defense and pin opponents in their own half.
        </p>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<p>As a result of Rayo’s narrow fullback, the Barca wingers are often unmarked when they do not have the ball. Many of the Barca attacks began through Dembele or Raphinha because they were often open to receive the ball. This seems to be the game plan for Rayo as they have a specific plan to defend against crosses:</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185515959-f9e17a47-a710-40a7-bdf5-5c8271788f7f.png" width="350" height=auto>
<p>As you can see from the figure above, now we assume the ball is passed to Dembele on the left wing. Note how the whole Rayo defensive line is immediately drawn towards the left side. The two midfielders on the left side are positioned near the left wing to deny any spaces. The wing is so packed that it is very hard for Barca to play short passes or for the wingers to get past their man. The two runs that Pedri or Alba can make in this situation (indicated by the back arrow above) is stifled by the sheer number of defenders in that area. Even if they are able to receive the ball it is very hard for them to make plays out of it. Inside the box Lewandowksi is usually marked by two defenders, and they still have defenders to further retreat into the box should Gavi and Raphinha come in the middle to receive a potential Dembele cross. Such was the theme during the entire match, where Barca passed out to the wings a lot but failed to progress through the middle as we would’ve loved to. For the chances we created we either didn’t manage to get a good shot out of it or the Rayo keeper just made a good save.</p>
<h4>Film Breakdown - What we can do to break the Rayo defense</h4>
<p>Here is where I detail what we could’ve done against Rayo’s defense, and how we should deal with a team that plays like Rayo in the future. I am including some points about Barca’s playstyle here as well to illustrate what I just said.</p>
<div class="box">
    <p class="bold">*Beginner tips</p>
    <p> My advice for you is to watch the clip first, and then read what I have to say about the clip. After that try to watch the clip again and pay attention to the points that I made. The trick is to always look around the whole pitch, not just paying attention to the ball. Don’t be afraid to stop or rewind the clip because things may not be very apparent at first glance, and it is certainly not easy to keep track of 22 people on the pitch. Even a person like me who is familiar with the team’s playstyle cannot spot all of these when watching the game in real time. If you do it right you will realize that there is much more happening on the pitch than what you can see when you first watch the clip :)</p>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<p>First let’s take a look at this clip:</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen src="https://www.kapwing.com/e/62fecd9f0248e4008c98c72e" height=400, width=650></iframe>
<br>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185519333-ed585a3d-31a4-4de0-b085-4d1347b38f49.png">
<p>This is an example of how Barca progressed the ball from deep (reference this photo to the figure above where I talked about how Barca advanced the ball, the lines are there to help you). As you can see Gavi dropped deep to receive the ball from Busquets and played a quick pass to Pedri, who did an audacious skill to lose his marker. Notice the 442 defensive formation from Rayo in the photo, and also how the backtrack of Gavi pulled a Rayo defender towards him and opened up some free space between the two 4 men lines of Rayo.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185519326-5851faf9-65fb-461c-ba39-cf81b5f7d596.png">
<p>Once the ball gets to Pedri and he offloads it to Busquets the Rayo defense immediately converges to the center of the pitch. Pay attention to the photo above to see how there are 5 Rayo players as opposed to 2 Barca players in the center of the field near the ball as indicated by the red circle. Also from the photo you can see in fact the whole Rayo team is positioned very narrowly, as apparent when you can see the whole Rayo team (except for the gk) in the photo but only 7 Barca players. Barca are trying to stretch the pitch while Rayo are trying to deny any space when the ball gets into the center area of their own half. Contrast the three photos shown here and you’ll see how much more space Barca players are afforded when they are either in their own half (1st photo) or on the wing (photo below). The problem with crowding the midfield, however, is that if the opponent manages to break the press they can take advantage of the gap between the midfield and the defense line, indicated by blue in the photo (where Lewandowksi and Dembele are standing). In this case Barca can potentially create a numerical advantage* if they can get the ball into the blue area.</p>
<div class="box">
    <p class="bold">*Beginner tips</p>
    <p>From the position above Barca can attack the Rayo defense with a front 5 as explained above. Apart from Dembele and Lewandowski who are already in the blue area, Pedri and Gavi are already making their runs forward following their passes. Raphinha is on the right wing out of the photo and can make a run forward to take advantage of the Rayo left back pushing forward over the blue area (as seen in the photo above)</p>
</div>
<br>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185519328-55f8ff7e-adc0-4182-9aed-d6bf37c9737d.png">
<p>Fast forward a few frames when Dembele gets the ball on the left wing from an Alba pass. First thing to pay attention to is how the Rayo right back is not engaging the ball, instead trying to backtrack. He is clearly trying to buy time for the midfield to recover and nullify the numerical advantage Barca have, while not exposing too much space in the box. It is therefore unwise for Dembele to do what he did, squaring off with his man to allow the Rayo defense to reset. I believe that he should take advantage of the situation and make a quick progressive pass to dislodge the defense. Here is how I think it could have played out: Pedri can make a run to the left wing as indicated by the red arrow, and the right center back of Rayo will have no choice but to follow him. Lewandowski, Gavi and Raphinha can then make a run and create a 3v2 advantage inside the box. Now Dembele will have the choice of a diagonal pass to Pedri or a cross into the box.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185519330-649468a8-2a48-4b27-9602-584f3cacc7a1.png">
<p>When Dembele finally decided to make his move, the Rayo defense had already fully recovered and we failed to capitalize on the advantage we created. His choice to make a pass to Pedri was the right one under these circumstances, but the end result was dismal and we lost possession because of that. Another option is to find the overlapping Alba who can probably put in a cross, but it will not be a high percentage chance because of the packed central area in the box.</p>
<p>Here is another way to get a good shot off against the defense:</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen src="https://www.kapwing.com/e/62fee21660bd4a00e896165f" height=400, width=650></iframe>
<br>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521147-d9b5240a-0bad-4433-bd17-9b13935b151f.png">
<p>Again, Barca are able to bypass the Rayo press quickly. As Pedri brings the ball up, the Rayo defense collapses to the left wing in order to deny passes. You can see in the photo that the Rayo right back is positioned in the middle. The problem with this tactic is the space it leaves on the other wing, and Barca is quick to exploit it this time.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521144-18495655-d5b7-43ab-89fd-31b5153ec1e3.png">
<p>When the pass goes to Gavi it is clear how much space there is for Dembele on the right wing (as shown in red). A quick pass into the region allowed Dembele to fake a shot before unleashing a left foot shot. While he did not score on this occasion it is clear that this is a very effective tactic for us. Unfortunately we did not see too many possessions of us switching sides quickly to create a chance.</p>
<p>Here is another way to get a good shot off against the defense: </p>
<iframe allowfullscreen src="https://www.kapwing.com/e/62fee47bb2e54300598e78d0" height=400, width=650></iframe>
<br>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521723-e5424ac6-f9d4-437f-af2d-6ba5b8ece463.png">
<p>Here the Rayo midfield did not press Busquets, and he had the space to make a long pass to find Dembele on the right wing.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521728-6c105971-a930-4fe6-b25c-b5290f9e2fb6.png">
<p>As soon as he gets the ball he takes it to the baseline. Pay attention to the Rayo left back here, in this instant he is still guarding Raphinha.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521712-9e72803d-11be-4046-8e40-94e397325950.png">
<p>However as he ran into the box, Raphinha did not follow him inside. You can see the Rayo left back looking back and realizing he is not within range to guard Raphinha. However because Rayo were defending in a zone he still continued his retreat into the box, probably expecting the Rayo midfidder (red circle) to pick Raphinha up. But as you can see the midfielder was following Lewandowski’s run and did not realize that Raphinha was open without a marker. Meanwhile, Raphinha saw the opening in the defense and started to make his move towards the top of the box.</p>
<img width="700" height=auto src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111542714/185521718-6c16c8cd-adfe-4ae9-8739-7cecba0a51ee.png">
<p>This is the moment before Dembele made the pass. We can see how much space there was on the top of the Rayo box. This is an inherent problem that comes from a very compact defense that crowds up a single area of the pitch - it is easy for this kind of miscommunication to happen and leave the opponents wide open. Perhaps it was also Rayo’s game plan to give up these kinds of shots further away from goal in order to deter any shots in front of goal. Either way, this is a very makeable shot for Raphinha but unfortunately he did not manage to hit the target.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with all the kudos to Rayo for coming up with such a solid defensive strategy, there are many ways we could’ve adjusted to the defense and create more scoring chances. And we did manage to solve at least some parts of the defensive puzzle at times, but simply cannot produce the finish . It is also abundantly clear that some of the missed opportunities are because of a lack of chemistry, and that is something that should come with more game time and experience. It will not come as a surprise if other teams look at this game and try to defend against us in the same way, so we should be prepared to counter should that happen in the future. Sure it is not ideal to draw our season opener, but it is time for us to put this game away and prepare for our next fixture - away at Sociedad. As any long time fan will know this is always a very tough fixture for us. Last season we had to dig deep on the defensive end and thanks to a few big misses from their strikers to hang on to a 1-0 win. Let’s hope we can finally get back to winning ways this weekend.</p>
<h4>Why it is ridiculous to sell Frenkie De Jong</h4>
<p>I mentioned how Frenkie De Jong put on a show this game, and here are some highlights of those moments:</p>
<p>Look at this, perfect anticipation to catch the Rayo defender completely off guard. A dangerous turnover just outside their own box creating one of the biggest chances of the game, one that you’d expect a top class striker like Lewandowki to bury in the net. However it grazed past the far post and onto the stands.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen src="https://www.kapwing.com/e/62fee70561c09800955d083b" height=400, width=650></iframe>
<br>
<p>And here you can see him starting from the back, fending off two defenders and threading a perfect pass to Alba. Before receiving the ball back from Busquets, as you can see below the whole Rayo “wall” was completely set up at that moment.</p>

<p>And of course he proceeded to take on two Rayo defenders and somehow managed to create an opening for Lewandowski in the box who was closely marked throughout the game. Maybe Lewandowksi could have taken the shot first time, but the contact that his defender made that caused him to fall down can very well be counted as a foul against them. Apparently the ref doesn’t think so so another chance goes astray. </p>

<p>And this one:</p>

<p>It started off with Frenkie receiving the ball from Ter Stegan, with all Rayo players ahead of him. What if I tell you within a few seconds he would have opened up the defense to create a 4 on 4 fastbreak? Well that is exactly what happened:</p>

<p>Just 6 seconds later Lewandowski was running with the ball with 4 Barca players in front of him making runs against the 4 men defensive line of Rayo. (Note how much space the wingers have here while 4 the Rayo defenders are marking the two center players 2v1, I am not joking when I told you that Rayo’s game plan was to play an extremely narrow defensive line as you can clearly see here) How did he do it? Here’s the clip. </p>s

<p>Unfortunately this ended as a foul on Lewandowski again, though this time the ref rightly called it a foul and showed a yellow card.</p>
<p>With this kind of form Frenkie definitely deserves to start the next game. He should certainly be taking up Gavi’s place in Sunday’s game. This performance also serves as a reminder to the Barca board who wanted him gone to fund a big money move- there is no player they can bring in who can replace Frenkie De Jong’s place in this team. And to be frank, who will want to come to Barca after seeing how they forced De Jong to leave?</p>
<h3>Expectations - a reality check</h3>
<p>Judging from the atmosphere in the stadium I think there will be a lot of fans who think that we can be challenging for titles instantly. I do hope that this game will be a wake up call for everyone that currently we are not better than any la liga team, let alone being the title favorites. Not to say that it cannot be done but there is clearly a lot of work to be put in if we want to compete with the likes of Real Madrid, Sevilla, Atletico, Real Sociedad etc. While we did have a good run last year, there are also problems that have been plaguing us since last season have not been solved yet. Many of those cannot be dealt with just by bringing in a host of good players, especially on the defensive end. It is also ridiculous to suggest that a team that looks good on paper will be competitive on the pitch, one just has to look to the French Capital if they need any kind of proof. For anyone who thinks our squad looks good enough to compete with high budget and squad depth teams like Man City, I am sorry that is just not how football works. For the sake of this team I urge fans to lower their expectations, don’t focus on only the results but pay attention to what is actually happening on the pitch.s</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that we can be happy with a draw against Rayo at home. No we are a team that always wants to win regardless of what players we are putting out there. But to say that we are expected to win is just being disrespectful to the opponents and being overconfident with our own abilities. There will certainly be fans of other teams who will happily call us a flop when we fall short, so we should not be adding to the fire by overeating our team.</p>
